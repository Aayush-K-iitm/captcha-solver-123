# CAPTCHA Solver Demo A simple single-page web application demonstrating a CAPTCHA input and verification mechanism, styled with Tailwind CSS. It defaults to an attached sample image (sample.png) with a hardcoded solution. ## Features - Displays a CAPTCHA image. - Allows input for the CAPTCHA text. - Verifies the input against a known solution (for the default image). - Supports loading external CAPTCHA images via URL parameter. - Responsive design using Tailwind CSS. ## Usage 1. Open index.html in your browser. 2. The default CAPTCHA image will be sample.png (solution: "ADUR3"). 3. You can load a different image by appending `?url=https://example.com/your-captcha.png` to the URL. 4. Enter "ADUR3" in the text field and click "Verify" for the default image. ## Limitations The "solver" only knows the solution for sample.png. For other images loaded via URL, it acts as a verification interface without an inherent solving capability.
